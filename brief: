Analytics Tools Coding Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to create a simple archive of the top 10 tracks on Last.fm for any given week. The archive should be browsable by date.

- Write an application that parses the data from the weekly toplist found at http://www.last.fm/charts/tracks/top/place/all. It should store the rank, title, artist and number of listeners for each of the top 10 items in a database. It should be possible to set up a recurring job that fetches the data automatically.

- Create a basic web page that displays the top 10 tracks for a given week (supposing that you have the data). There should be an input mechanism where the user can enter the date for which a list should be displayed. When retrieving the data for display, a cache layer should be utilized to prevent the database from being queried each time data is needed.

- Use your favorite JavaScript-based graphing library to provide and interesting visualization of the data.

- Please include instructions on how to install and run the application.

- The backend code should be written in Python.
